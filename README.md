Below is a professional, step-by-step solution to the physics problem based on the information provided: a 3 kg object explodes into three parts with a mass ratio of 1:1:3, where the first two parts move with equal speed \( v \) at an angle \( \theta \) to each other, and we need to determine the velocity (magnitude) of the third part. Since the exact values of \( v \) and \( \theta \) were not specified, I’ll derive the general solution and verify it with a special case (\( \theta = 90^\circ \)) to ensure consistency with typical HSC Bangladesh physics problems.

---

### Problem Statement
A 3 kg object, initially at rest, explodes into three fragments with masses in the ratio 1:1:3. The first two fragments move with equal speed \( v \) at an angle \( \theta \) to each other. Determine the magnitude of the velocity of the third fragment.

---

### Step 1: Define the Masses
The mass ratio is 1:1:3, and the total mass is 3 kg. Let the total "parts" of the ratio be \( 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 \). Thus:
- Mass of the first fragment, \( m_1 = \frac{1}{5} \times 3 = 0.6 \, \text{kg} \)
- Mass of the second fragment, \( m_2 = \frac{1}{5} \times 3 = 0.6 \, \text{kg} \)
- Mass of the third fragment, \( m_3 = \frac{3}{5} \times 3 = 1.8 \, \text{kg} \)

Verification: \( m_1 + m_2 + m_3 = 0.6 + 0.6 + 1.8 = 3 \, \text{kg} \), which matches the total mass.

---

### Step 2: Apply Conservation of Momentum
Since the object is initially at rest, its initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum after the explosion must also be zero:
\[ \vec{p}_{\text{initial}} = \vec{p}_{\text{final}} = 0 \]
\[ m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2 + m_3 \vec{v}_3 = 0 \]
where:
- \( \vec{v}_1 \) is the velocity of the first fragment,
- \( \vec{v}_2 \) is the velocity of the second fragment,
- \( \vec{v}_3 \) is the velocity of the third fragment (to be found).

---

### Step 3: Assign Velocity Vectors
To proceed, assign coordinates in a 2D plane (since the problem involves an angle \( \theta \) between two velocities):
- Let \( \vec{v}_1 \) be along the positive x-axis: \( \vec{v}_1 = (v, 0) \), where \( v \) is the speed of the first fragment.
- Let \( \vec{v}_2 \) be at an angle \( \theta \) to \( \vec{v}_1 \). Using trigonometry:
  \[ \vec{v}_2 = (v \cos \theta, v \sin \theta) \]
- Let \( \vec{v}_3 = (v_{3x}, v_{3y}) \), the velocity of the third fragment, with magnitude \( |\vec{v}_3| \) to be determined.

The magnitudes are:
- \( |\vec{v}_1| = v \),
- \( |\vec{v}_2| = v \) (given that the first two parts move with equal speed),
- \( |\vec{v}_3| \) is unknown.

---

### Step 4: Write Momentum Equations
Substitute the masses and velocities into the momentum conservation equation:
\[ m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2 + m_3 \vec{v}_3 = 0 \]
\[ 0.6 (v, 0) + 0.6 (v \cos \theta, v \sin \theta) + 1.8 (v_{3x}, v_{3y}) = (0, 0) \]

Separate into x- and y-components:

#### X-component:
\[ 0.6 v + 0.6 v \cos \theta + 1.8 v_{3x} = 0 \]
Factor out \( v \):
\[ v (0.6 + 0.6 \cos \theta) + 1.8 v_{3x} = 0 \]
\[ 0.6 v (1 + \cos \theta) + 1.8 v_{3x} = 0 \]
Solve for \( v_{3x} \):
\[ 1.8 v_{3x} = -0.6 v (1 + \cos \theta) \]
\[ v_{3x} = -\frac{0.6 v (1 + \cos \theta)}{1.8} \]
\[ v_{3x} = -\frac{v (1 + \cos \theta)}{3} \]

#### Y-component:
\[ 0 + 0.6 v \sin \theta + 1.8 v_{3y} = 0 \]
\[ 0.6 v \sin \theta + 1.8 v_{3y} = 0 \]
Solve for \( v_{3y} \):
\[ 1.8 v_{3y} = -0.6 v \sin \theta \]
\[ v_{3y} = -\frac{0.6 v \sin \theta}{1.8} \]
\[ v_{3y} = -\frac{v \sin \theta}{3} \]

Thus, the velocity vector of the third fragment is:
\[ \vec{v}_3 = \left( -\frac{v (1 + \cos \theta)}{3}, -\frac{v \sin \theta}{3} \right) \]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the Magnitude of \( \vec{v}_3 \)
The magnitude \( |\vec{v}_3| \) is:
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \sqrt{(v_{3x})^2 + (v_{3y})^2} \]
Substitute:
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \sqrt{\left( -\frac{v (1 + \cos \theta)}{3} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{v \sin \theta}{3} \right)^2} \]
Factor out common terms:
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \sqrt{\frac{v^2 (1 + \cos \theta)^2}{9} + \frac{v^2 \sin^2 \theta}{9}} \]
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \sqrt{\frac{v^2}{9} \left[ (1 + \cos \theta)^2 + \sin^2 \theta \right]} \]
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \frac{v}{3} \sqrt{(1 + \cos \theta)^2 + \sin^2 \theta} \]

#### Simplify the expression inside the square root:
Expand \( (1 + \cos \theta)^2 \):
\[ (1 + \cos \theta)^2 = 1 + 2 \cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta \]
Add \( \sin^2 \theta \):
\[ (1 + \cos \theta)^2 + \sin^2 \theta = 1 + 2 \cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta \]
Use the identity \( \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \):
\[ 1 + 2 \cos \theta + 1 = 2 + 2 \cos \theta \]
\[ = 2 (1 + \cos \theta) \]

So:
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \frac{v}{3} \sqrt{2 (1 + \cos \theta)} \]
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \frac{v \sqrt{2 (1 + \cos \theta)}}{3} \]

This is the general expression for the speed of the third fragment.

---

### Step 6: Verify with \( \theta = 90^\circ \)
In many explosion problems (and your initial description), \( \theta = 90^\circ \) is common. Test the formula:
- \( 1 + \cos 90^\circ = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
- \( |\vec{v}_3| = \frac{v \sqrt{2 \cdot 1}}{3} = \frac{v \sqrt{2}}{3} \)

This matches the result from similar HSC problems (e.g., if \( v = 21 \, \text{m/s} \), then \( |\vec{v}_3| = \frac{21 \sqrt{2}}{3} \approx 9.89 \, \text{m/s} \)), confirming the derivation’s correctness.

---

### Step 7: Final Answer
The magnitude of the velocity of the third fragment is:
\[ |\vec{v}_3| = \frac{v \sqrt{2 (1 + \cos \theta)}}{3} \]
where:
- \( v \) is the speed of the first two fragments,
- \( \theta \) is the angle between the velocities of the first two fragments.

#### Note:
Since the problem didn’t specify \( v \) or \( \theta \), this is the general solution. If your drawing provides specific values (e.g., \( v = 21 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \theta = 90^\circ \)), substitute them:
- For \( v = 21 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \theta = 90^\circ \): \( |\vec{v}_3| \approx 9.89 \, \text{m/s} \).
- For other values, plug them into the formula.

Please provide \( v \) and \( \theta \) from your drawing for an exact numerical answer!
